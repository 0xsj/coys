have two options

- a lamda out to transcribe
- a server

## if we do a server,

1. upload()
2. upload into s3 bucket
3. the uploaded data then should be transcribed, once the upload is completed
4. the server then has to listen to the transcription services to initiate the main functionality

### think about how its going to travel
